# RNWebviewFullscreen
Trying to make the React Native Webview enter in FullScreen Mode on Android (use React Native Webview Bridge as base to writing this example).

Only work on RN versions prior to 0.29.0, because of the change on how to get access to current Activity on Android Native Component: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.29.0

# Install
npm install

# Run
react-native run-android
